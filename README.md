# Lode Wars
Lode Wars is a tactical, goal-oriented team game, in which players took on the role of alien miners in a whimsical future setting: a thinking man's action game, accessible enough to be enjoyed for its own simple pleasures but detailed and complex enough to keep each game interesting. 

This project is a full revival of the original concept using the more modern feature-set available in BYOND.
