<font size=+1><b>Overview</b></font>
<p>Lode Wars is an overhead digging action game in which players take the part of alien mercenary miners in the rough and tumble world of interstellar mining competition. The game's basics are fairly easy to learn: once you select a race and a team, walk into solid dirt in order to start digging. Dig to create tunnels to get from one part of the mine to another, and to expose valuable ore. Dig ore out of the dirt, collect a bundle, and take it back to your base to deposit in your team's ore bin for points. At the end of the round, you earn money based on your team's score and have a chance to be promoted to a higher pay grade if you've worked hard enough. You can then spend that money at your team's shop console to buy equipment to help mine more effectively. But be careful! Your team isn't the only team with a stake in this mine, and your competitors won't always play nice. Claim-jumping is the least of your worries here on the lawless frontiers of space: gunfights, sabotage, and outright robbery are commonplace.

<font size=+1><b>Background</b></font>
</a>
<p>In what we would call the 33rd century, the galaxy was undergoing an interstellar revolution, a veritable galactic renaissance. As one intelligent species after another mastered outer space, solar system after solar system became connected in a glorious brotherhood of worlds.</p>

<p>(Humans were, unfortunately, not part of this brotherhood of worlds--they wiped themselves out in 2237 when the emperor of the United States, his sense of geography muddled by generations of inbreeding, mistakingly singled out America as the next target in the centuries-long War on Terror. The United States, finding itself under attack, promptly launched its entire nuclear arsenal, and naturally the other two superpowers of the day--Switzerland and the People's Republic of California--quickly followed suit, and with the products of a massive 150-year-long arms race being expended in a matter of days it wasn't pretty. On the plus side, while most species were rendered extinct instantaneously, cockroaches not only survived the nuclear apocalypse but flourished afterwords--having mutated into a super-intelligent race from the fallout, the roaches immediately proceeded to rebuild in only two centuries a vast worldwide civilization that not only matched but surpassed the peak of human achievement. Then an asteroid demolished Earth, but that is neither here nor there.)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the expansion of so many intelligent worlds into space eventually proved to be problematic. Almost every single species that took to the stars had done so primarily to find new sources of raw materials. Even the hundreds of known uninhabited worlds and millions of asteroids proved to be too small to comfortably accomodate the needs of interstellar civilization for long, and the universe stood on the brink of war over conflicting territorial claims. At the last minute, a galaxy-wide conference was called to find a peaceful resolution to the resource crisis. The conference created an international Universal Mining Authority. The UMA, it was decided, would allow corporations with competing claims to engage in small-scale mining in contested areas, and would award exclusive mining rights to whichever side could most effectively exploit the area's mineral resources, determined on the basis of amount and value of ore collected.</p>

<p>This compromise was agreed to by all parties involved, and the galaxy's major mining interests made a great public display of agreeing to abide by all the UMA's rules and regulations. In the narrow mine tunnels deep in the ground, however, anything goes, and the galaxy's eight largest remaining mining corporations will stop at nothing to prevent their competitors from being awarded a claim. This has given rise to a new class of temporary mercenary-miner, with thugs and goons being hired alongside honest, hardworking diggers, smuggled under the nose of the UMA in order to out-muscle the competition. The galaxy sleeps in peace and security, confident that a "peaceful" solution to the resource crisis was found, but on countless worlds on the frontier of civilized space, another war of sorts is being fought, a war with not just guns, but picks and shovels, fists, teeth, and anything else at hand. Few galactic historians will pay much attention to these underground battlefields, but in their own right they will help to shape the future as much as any other battle.</p>

<a name="basics">
<font size=+1><b>How to play</b></font>
</a>
<p>When logging in or at the start of a new round, you will be asked to pick both a race and a team. As soon as you do, you'll spawn inside your team's base, ready to start playing. Along the left side of your screen, you'll notice a display of your stats, as well as three bars: health, energy, and radiation. <font color=#FF0000><b>Health</b></font> is, simply enough, an indication of your health--if it reaches zero, from being attacked by enemies or being careless with high explosives, etc. you'll die. When you die, you drop any items you're carrying, and will have to sit out for several seconds before your team's cloning facilities can reproduce you. Be warned, however, that your employers will not be happy with you if they have to spend a lot of time and money cloning you. Your <font color=#66FFFF><b>energy</b></font> is a measure of your electrical power reserves--you need power to use energy weapons, forcefield-capable armor, and any miscellaneous electronic gadgets you might have. Your <font color=#99FFCC><b>radiation</b></font> meter keeps track of how much radiation you've absorbed--you pick up radiation from the environment over time just by being outside of your team's base, but certain ore deposits are radioactive and may be highly hazardous to your health if you hang around them without any protective gear. The higher your radiation meter, the more slowly you recover health--if your radiation meter ever gets close to full, or else if it rises above your health level, you'll actually start taking damage! Above your health, energy, and radiation bars you'll notice a row of symbols with numbers by them, designating your attributes. From top to bottom, they are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Strength: Determines how much weight your miner can carry, and increases damage in hand-to-hand combat.</li>
<li>Attack: Has a major influence on hand-to-hand damage, and slightly boosts proficiency with weapons.</li>
<li>Speed: Determines how quickly your miner can move.</li>
<li>Dexterity: Dexterity affects how rapidly you can use items.</li>
<li>Intelligence: Influences how effective your miner is when using gadgets.</li>
<li>Aim: Determines accuracy and slightly boosts damage when firing weapons.</li>
<li>Defense: Reduces damage taken from attacks. Defense comes in two varieties, energy (force field) defense and physical defense. Some weapons can penetrate normal, physical defense, but force fields are effective against all attacks.
<li>Digging: Digging represents how quickly your miner can dig through dirt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your team's base provides several functions you should be aware of. The <a href="#shop">shop console</a> lets you spend your hard-earned money to rent equipment from your company. The base's computer can give you a readout of basic environmental parameters. The ore bin, located just outside the side door, is where you deposit ore to earn points for your team. Lastly, the base is equipped with a variety of equipment to help keep workers safe and healthy--while inside your team's base, you heal more quickly, regain spent energy, and safely shed any radiation you've absorbed.</p>

<p>Having done any shopping you want to do, it's time to equip yourself. Make sure to equip any armor or other worn gear you have. To use items, select them from your inventory and then click the target you wish to use them on. When you head out of your base, it's time to start digging--ore is generated in large clusters, so if you dig around and find one piece of ore, you can count on there being plenty more in the area. Once you've played through a few rounds and earned some money, there's a great variety of equipment to help you, from shovels and picks that help you dig faster to explosives to blast open large areas quickly to gadgets to locate hidden ore for you. When you do find some ore, dig it out of the dirt and gather as much as you can, then take it back to your team's ore bin to deposit it safely.</p>

<p>Well, mostly safely, anyhow. You're bound to encounter enemy miners sooner or later--at best, they're trying to out-dig you and get ore before you can. At worst, they can be highly armed and armored and out for blood--it's very helpful to know your <a href="#teams">teams</a> to assess the threat a given enemy poses, as some teams are much more dangerous than others! While applying a little muscle to the competition is always encouraged, murder <i>is</i> illegal except against trespassers and would-be thieves--your boss can keep you out of trouble with the law, but they won't be too happy with any miners that get too rowdy. Using nonlethal force often makes it harder to win fights, but if you use weapons that will knock out an enemy instead of killing them, you'll get in a lot less trouble. Or you can opt for the stealthy approach--if you can manage to sneak up to the enemy's ore bin, you can swipe some of their hard-earned ore.</p>

<p>If you work hard and don't make too much trouble down in the mines, you may find yourself promoted to higher ranks (denoted by the star at the top of your screen). More experienced miners tend to be more skilled, and get bigger paychecks too.</p>

<a name="character">
<font size=+1><b>Character development</b></font>
</a>

<p>Although Lode Wars is first and foremost an action game, it does have limited character development aspects. As you play through rounds, your miner accumulates money and ranks, allowing them to better compete in subsequent rounds. Your wealth and rank is automatically saved between games, even if you log out, the server goes down, or you start playing on a different server entirely, but the save transfering is not infallible--it's a good idea to use the save command when you're done playing on a given server to help make sure the save transfers OK.</p>

<a name="controls">
<font size=+1><b>Default keyboard commands</b></font>
</a>

<ul>
<li><b>ALT-0 through ALT-8</b>: Selects the numbered inventory slot (0 being the active item box, 1 through 8 being the eight standard inventory boxes)
<li><b>ALT-_ and ALT-=</b>: Cycle inventory up/down.
<li><b>ALT-G</b>: Enter get mode--click to pick up objects within range.
<li><b>ALT-A</b>: Enter attack mode--click to attack anything you can attack. You will not dig while under attack mode.
<li><b>ALT-D</b>: Exit get or attack command modes and go back to the default click mode.
<li><b>ALT-Numpad *</b>: Show or hide stat panels.
<li><b>ALT-Numpad -</b>: Condense or expand the heads-up display (HUD). Condensed mode is recommended for players with low-performance computers as it gets somewhat improved performance.
<li><b>ALT-Numpad +</b>: Show or hide team scores on-screen.
</ul>

<a name="shop">
<font size=+1><b>Shop console</b></font>
</a>

<p>Off in the corner of your team's base, you can find your team's shop console. Click on the shop console or use the shop command to start shopping, using a modified version of your inventory interface (using a different HUD border to display the difference). When you start shopping, you will see a list of item categories:
<ul>
<li><b>Equipment</b> covers miscellaneous worn or carried odds and ends to help you do your job.
<li><b>Weapons</b> are your basic implements of destruction.
<li><b>Ammo</b> is required by most weapons (specifically, non-energy weapons), although all weapons come loaded with one clip.
<li><b>Armor</b> can be worn to reduce damage.
<li><b>Items</b> range from expendable items such as explosives and medical supplies to various types of scanners and other gadgets to make your life easier--or your enemies' lives harder!
<li><b>Installations</b> are lasting structures that can be built to provide protection, supplies, or even transport far away from home.
</ul>
<p>Click on a category to display the items available for sale within that category. You can purchase individual items by clicking, or use the buy command to purchase multiple items at once, and the help command will give you information on items before purchasing them. Use the done button (green checkmark) to go back to the category listing or finish shopping (or simply move away from the console). If you're not sure of what you've bought already, press the shopping cart button to view your purchase order so far. If you see an item you don't want in your order, click on it or use the return verb to cancel your purchase, or press the cancel button (red X) to undo all your purchases and start shopping from scratch. Once you disengage the shop interface by clicking done or moving away, however, all your purchases are finalized--at that point you can only sell your items back for partial value.
</p>

<a name="equipment">
<font size=+1><b>Equipment and Inventory Management</b></font>
</a>
<p>A wide variety of equipment is available to you to assist in your activities. Click on (or press alt + the number of the appropriate inventory slot) to select or deselect an item--only one piece of equipment of a certain type (belts, body armor, held gadgets, etc.) can be used at a time. In the expanded (default) HUD mode, the on-screen inventory displays eight items at a time, plus your currently selected item (if any); click on the up or down arrows to go through your inventory, or press alt-underscore and alt +/= (next to the 0 key) to shift up and down.
</p>

<a name="races">
<font size=+1><b>Races</b></font>
</a>
<p>Although all major mining companies claim to be equal-opportunity employers, virtually all of their workers come from a handful of well-adapted species. Each race has different capabilities and is best suited for a different role.</p>
<ul>
<li><img src=zentan.png><b>Zentan</b> are a well-rounded race with very high <b>Intelligence</b>, making them adept at using many of the gadgets available to miners.
<li><img src=scradax.png><b>Scradax</b> are swift and vicious scavengers and hunters, although they are frail and incapable of carrying much weight or taking much punishment.
<li><img src=jezzer.png><b>Jezzers</b> are relatively slow and vulnerable compared to other races, but well adapted to tunneling and can dig much more quickly than any other miners.
<li><img src=horzek.png><b>Horzeks</b> are pretty slow, both physically and mentally, but very muscular and aggressive attackers who can easily carry and use the heaviest weapons available.
<li><img src=mobbel.png><b>Mobbels</b> are slippery amphibious scouts and infiltrators, bad at digging but excellent at navigating watery tunnels.
<li><img src=bolo.png><b>Bolos</b> are huge and terriffically powerful, but clumsy and easy targets.
</ul>

<a name="teams">
<font size=+1><b>Teams</b></font>
</a>
<p>Not all teams are created equally--each team has different resources, motivations, and equipment available to it. Keep this in mind when choosing a team!</p>
<ul>
<li><b><font color=#CC0000>The Imperial Kadazil Mining Federation</font></b> is a corporation run under the wing of the imperial Kadizillian military, and although its actual mining equipment is limited it outfits workers with unusually powerful arms and armor.
<li><b><font color=#0000FF>Dailim Mining Inc.</font></b> is a relatively new venture funded largely by multi-trillionaire Gazno Dailim III, singlemindedly focused on having the best and most expensive mining technology available.
<li><b><font color=#00CC00>The Pan-Galactic Eco Mining Cooperative</font></b> is a peace-loving environmentally responsible semi-volunteer organization dedicated to world-friendly, noncompetitive industry (space hippies). Their range of destructive equipment is limited, but they have several unique alternative technologies available that other teams don't use.
<li><b><font color=#FFF00>The Omni-Corp Mining Division</font></b> is a subsidiary of the galaxy's largest industrial conglomerate, and although it lacks specialized technologies it is equipped with a very wide variety of items.
<li><b><font color=#CC00CC>The Mezerit Excavation Company</font></b> is run by the secretive and reclusive Mezers of Mezlak-4, a high-tech race with superb knowledge of teleportation technologies.
<li><b><font color=#FFFFFF>Besseltech Enterprises</font></b> is a cutting-edge research company that hires small teams of miners on a regular basis to test out exclusive new experimental technology.
<li><b><font color=#333333>The Jagrinki</font></b> are an interstellar mafia group who run a semi-legitimate mining operation. Although not a proper mining outfit and lacking in real mining equipment, the Jagrinki are known to smuggle in all sorts of highly illegal weaponry to encourage cutthroat competition.
<li><b><font color=#FF9900>The Tygeron Mineral Extraction Corporation</font></b> is an old, well-established mining company. Massive but backwards, TME Corp has been slow to adapt to the new mining order and although it fields very large mining teams, it tends to issue inadequate, outdated equipment.
</ul>

<a name="ore">
<font size=+1><b>Types of Ore</b></font>
</a>
<p>All ore is found in large veins scattered throughout the map. Each vein contains a few dozen pieces of ore concentrated in an area a little larger than your view screen, with individual pieces of ore of varying grade. Some veins tend to have richer, more valuable grades of ore while others tend to have poorer grades, but no ore is completely worthless.</p>
<ul>
<li><img src=asbylite.png>Bluish-tinted <b>asbylite</b> ore is common, but not very valuable.
<li><img src=petrite.png>Yellow <b>petrite</b> ore is moderately common and of average value.
<li><img src=grezlorite.png>Green, blocky <b>grezlorite</b> ore isn't very common, but not worth much more than average.
<li><img src=hezerite.png>Pink crystals of <b>hezerite</b> are somewhat rare and fairly valuable.
<li><img src=draxilite.png>Rusty orange <b>draxilite</b> ore is rare and moderately valuable.
<li><img src=necite.png>Shiny, black <b>necite</b> is moderately rare and quite valuable.
<li><img src=kaburite.png>Bright, glowing <b>kaburite</b> is both rare and very, very valuable--but also dangerously radioactive!
</ul>
